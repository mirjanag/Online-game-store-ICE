# Online game store ICE #

### Project description ###

An online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world has available data from open sources:  user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales. The purpose of the project is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This allows one to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. The data goes back to 2016. Imagine that itâ€™s December 2016 and the company is planning a campaign for 2017. The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.
